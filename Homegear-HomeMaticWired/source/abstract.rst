Abstract
########

HomeMatic Wired is a home automation system produced by eQ-3.

Homegear fully supports HomeMatic Wired and, in contrast to most implementations available, communicates directly with the devices - there is no need for a CCU. In addition to the official HomeMatic Wired gateway you can use third party hardware to communicate with the bus.
