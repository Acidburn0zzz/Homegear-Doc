Communication Modules
*********************


Overview
========

The HomeMatic BidCoS module supports the following communication modules:

	* CUL (busware)
	* COC (busware)
	* CCD (busware)
	* SCC (busware)
	* CUNX (busware)
	* HomeMatic Wireless Module for Raspberry Pi (HM-MOD-RPI-PCB, eQ-3)
	* HomeMatic LAN Configuration Adapter (HM-CFG-LAN, eQ-3)
	* HomeMatic LAN Gateway (HM-LGW, eQ-3): Crashes sometimes
	* HomeMatic USB Configuration Adapter (HM-CFG-USB(-2), eQ-3)
	* CC1101 (Texas Instruments)
	* CC1101 with CC1190 (Texas Instruments)

If you just want a system that works without you having to invest a lot of time, buy the CUL stick. Of the devices in the list, it is probably the easiest to use. Additionally, it can be connected to a good antenna and supports AES handshakes and firmware updates.

.. note:: Of course, you can use multiple communication modules at the same time.
