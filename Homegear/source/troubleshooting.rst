Homegear Doesn't Start
**********************

Homegear Crashes with "Signal 6" or "Signal 11" Directly After Start
--------------------------------------------------------------------

This happens when the installed Homegear binary is not compatible to your CPU architecture or is compiled for different library versions. A common cause is the installation of the wrong package, e. g. you installed the package for "Debian Jessie" on "Raspbian Jessie" or the package for "Debian Wheezy" on "Debian Jessie".
