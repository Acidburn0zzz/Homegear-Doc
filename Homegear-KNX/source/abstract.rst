KNX is one of the best known field bus systems. It is an open standard and features a huge portfolio of devices by hundreds of companies.

Homegear fully supports KNX with all datapoint types. KNX group variables are automatically imported from one or more ETS project files. By providing JSON-encoded metadata in ETS, variables can be grouped together into one Homegear device.
