Intertechno switching actuators are probably the cheapest remote-controllable ones available. Homegear supports the following devices:

* All new (V3 or pairable) Intertechno switching actuators and remotes
* The "original" old Intertechno switching actuators and remotes
* Elro AB440
* b1/Toom
* REV Ritter

If your Intertechno device is missing, feel free to contact us. It can easily be added.
